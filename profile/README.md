> A curated list of credits, links, and community information related to the framework.

### üöÄ Update Notice

This project now uses a **txAdmin recipe** for simplified setup, resource management, and deployment.  
All core framework **resources are now separated into individual repositories** under the Mythic Framework Official GitHub organization.  
This change was made to promote modularity, make community contributions easier, and streamline development and updates.

üëâ **To get started**, visit the official txAdmin recipe repository:  
üîó [Mythic-Framework/txAdminRecipe](https://github.com/Mythic-Framework/txAdminRecipe)

The recipe will handle:

- Automatic cloning of all required resources.
- Proper resource structure and organization.
- Configuration for txAdmin-based servers.
- Easy customization and future updates.

You can explore all the available standalone resources here:  
üîç [Mythic-Framework GitHub Repositories](https://github.com/orgs/Mythic-Framework/repositories)
